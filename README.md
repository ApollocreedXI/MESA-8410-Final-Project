Welcome to my GBV research project.

In this repository, you will find the original Excel files initially used in the data preprocessing process.


This is:
	admin_long data
; citizen_full data 
; police_full data 
; police_baseline 

The _cleaned suffix denotes the preprocessed versions of the data

Two other data frames, not mentioned, are used for modeling: the treatment_groups and statistical tests data frames. 

The Python scripts included contain all the code utilized to preprocess, create infographics, and model.

I recommend starting with the "New_Final_Project_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb" and then the "New_Final_Project_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb". From here the order of the remaining python files does not necessarily matter.
